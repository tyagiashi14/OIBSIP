                        JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language
                        with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages,
                        many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
                        JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
                        object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

                    <h2>Learn Python - in fun way!</h2>
                    <p>
                        Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes
                        code readability with the use of significant indentation.<br>

                        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                        including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It
                        is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard
                        library.<br>

                        Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming
                        language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.Python 2.0 was released in 2000.
                        Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with
                        earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.

                        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.<br>
                        HTML describes the structure of a Web page.<br>
                        HTML consists of a series of elements.<br>
                        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.<br>
                        HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this
                        is a link", etc.

                    <h2>Learn C++ - in fun way!</h2>
                    <p>
                        C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.<br>

                        C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.<br>

                        C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.<br>
                        C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.<br>

                        C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.<br>

                        C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and
                        allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.<br>

                        C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple
                        platforms.<br>

                        C++ is fun and easy to learn!
